  abstract={This article describes a set of control algorithms for in-hand object handling using a parallel jaw gripper equipped with force/tactile sensors. The control strategy is model based and relies upon the limit surface concept. The LuGre friction model is combined with the limit surface method to set up a dynamic model of soft contact. The model is exploited to estimate the relative velocity of the object with respect to the fingers, so as to control the grip force to counteract possible slipping events due to external disturbances. Force/tactile feedback, the only perception source used by the algorithms, is suitably exploited not only for safe grasping of a variety of objects with uncertain weight and inertial properties, but also for in-hand manipulation actions, like object pivoting or gripper pivoting. Since the algorithm is based on the control of the object velocity, accuracy of the desired object positioning depends on the initial grasp configuration, as well as on the accuracy of the friction model parameters. Such manipulation skills are evaluated in the execution of various pick and place tasks typical of an in-store logistic scenario.},

  abstract={Manipulation planning and control are relevant building blocks of a robotic system and their tight integration is a key factor to improve robot autonomy and allows robots to perform manipulation tasks of increasing complexity, such as those needed in the in-store logistics domain. Supermarkets contain a large variety of objects to be placed on the shelf layers with specific constraints, doing this with a robot is a challenge and requires a high dexterity. However, an integration of reactive grasping control and motion planning can allow robots to perform such tasks even with grippers with limited dexterity. The main contribution of the letter is a novel method for planning manipulation tasks to be executed using a reactive control layer that provides more control modalities, i.e., slipping avoidance and controlled sliding. Experiments with a new force/tactile sensor equipping the gripper of a mobile manipulator show that the approach allows the robot to successfully perform manipulation tasks unfeasible with a standard fixed grasp.},

abstract = "The paper presents a novel strategy to control the instantaneous rotational velocity of a planar slider subject to a soft contact with friction and to external loads, including gravity. The approach is based on a novel model that combines the LuGre dynamic friction model with the limit surface concept for two main reasons. First, the limit surface allows considering both translational and rotational sliding motions. Secondly, the actual friction provided at the contact by the LuGre dynamic model exhibits dependence on the rate of variation of the external loads and, thus, it is worthwhile in dynamic conditions. Slipping control is realized by acting on the friction forces through the normal load so as to stably regulate the velocity of the slider to zero. The control law exploits a nonlinear observer, based on the proposed model, to estimate the instantaneous rotational velocity of the slider, which is used to compute the normal load necessary to ensure a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of the slider. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in an application of robotic manipulation using an industrial gripper sensorized with force/tactile sensors."

In-hand motion of the manipulated object highly depends on the friction forces acting at the contact surfaces. Soft contacts allow torsional frictions as well as friction forces, therefore robots can perform more complex manipulation abilities, like object pivoting. Control of the pivoting sliding motion is very difficult especially without any visual feedback.

ABSTRACT = {Tactile data perception is of paramount importance in todayâ€™s robotics applications. This paper describes the latest design of the tactile sensor developed in our laboratory. Both the hardware and firmware concepts are reported in detail in order to allow the research community the sensor reproduction, also according to their needs. The sensor is based on optoelectronic technology and the pad shape can be adapted to various robotics applications. A flat surface, as the one proposed in this paper, can be well exploited if the object sizes are smaller than the pad and/or the shape recognition is needed, while a domed pad can be used to manipulate bigger objects. Compared to the previous version, the novel tactile sensor has a larger sensing area and a more robust electronic, mechanical and software design that yields less noise and higher flexibility. The proposed design exploits standard PCB manufacturing processes and advanced but now commercial 3D printing processes for the realization of all components. A GitHub repository has been prepared with all files needed to allow the reproduction of the sensor for the interested reader. The whole sensor has been tested with a maximum load equal to 15N, by showing a sensitivity equal to 0.018V/N. Moreover, a complete and detailed characterization for the single taxel and the whole pad is reported to show the potentialities of the sensor also in terms of response time, repeatability, hysteresis and signal to noise ratio.},

abstract = {Robotic manipulation of objects using the sole tactile feedback is a challenge. If the contact between the robot end effector and the manipulated object is distributed, the robot can exchange both friction forces and torques with it. The friction highly influences the motion of the object. By controlling the friction it is possible to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as moving the object with respect to the end effector by executing a controlled sliding motion. If the motion is a rotation with respect to the end effector, the corresponding maneuver is called pivoting. Control of the pivoting motion is considerably difficult, especially without any visual feedback. This paper proposes a novel method to regulate the object angular position, by means of a pivoting maneuver, through a parallel gripper endowed with force/tactile sensors. The strategy is based on a novel nonlinear observer that estimates the sliding velocity from force/torque measurements and a model of the sliding dynamics. We exploit the Limit Surface concept and the LuGre friction model to build a dynamic model of a planar slider. We show, through experimental results, that simple parallel grippers are able to execute such maneuvers that correspond to adding a virtual joint between the fingers, thus enlarging the robot workspace.}

ABSTRACT={Modern scenarios in robotics involve human-robot collaboration or robot-robot cooperation in unstructured environments. In human-robot collaboration, the objective is to relieve humans from repetitive and wearing tasks. This is the case of a retail store, where the robot could help a clerk to refill a shelf or an elderly customer to pick an item from an uncomfortable location. In robot-robot cooperation, automated logistics scenarios, such as warehouses, distribution centers and supermarkets, often require repetitive and sequential pick and place tasks that can be executed more efficiently by exchanging objects between robots, provided that they are endowed with object handover ability. Use of a robot for passing objects is justified only if the handover operation is sufficiently intuitive for the involved humans, fluid and natural, with a speed comparable to that typical of a human-human object exchange. The approach proposed in this paper strongly relies on visual and haptic perception combined with suitable algorithms for controlling both robot motion, to allow the robot to adapt to human behavior, and grip force, to ensure a safe handover. The control strategy combines model-based reactive control methods with an event-driven state machine encoding a human-inspired behavior during a handover task, which involves both linear and torsional loads, without requiring explicit learning from human demonstration. Experiments in a supermarket-like environment with humans and robots communicating only through haptic cues demonstrate the relevance of force/tactile feedback in accomplishing handover operations in a collaborative task.}
